# World-of-games
For DevOps course project

### How to play: ###

Gameplay is quite simple. Clone the project and run from main. The game will basically
ask for your name and give you 3 game options. and up to 5 difficulty levels.

Once a game is completed, you will be redirected to the main menu and be given the option
to play another game. From the main menu, you can exit the program by simply typing 'end'.

Currently no parameters were given for the actual games, so every choice will basically
give you the same message and send you back to the main menu.
